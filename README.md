## UFO-Sightings
 
## Project Overview:
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results:
The webpage initially loads the entire data table, with 5 search boxes on the left hand side, as shown in the image below.

To search the user enters a search criterion and presses enter. Once done, the table adjusts for the search results. A user can enter one search item as seen below:
