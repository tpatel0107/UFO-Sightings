## UFO-Sightings
 
## Project Overview:
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results:
The webpage initially loads the entire data table, with 5 search boxes on the left hand side, as shown in the image below.

To search the user enters a search criterion and presses enter. Once done, the table adjusts for the search results. A user can enter one search item as seen below:

Or multple search items:

## Summary:
While the website currently performs its purpose, there are a few ways to improve it. A current challenge of the webpage is that once a search is performed and filtered, in order to return to the original table, you need to refresh the page.

I would add drop-down menus to the search criteria to help users when they don't know the exact name, place they want to search. In addition, I'd add a reset button that refreshes the page and clears the search criteria. Finally, I would add a map, that shows the location of all the UFO sightings, and allow the user to hover over the map points to see the associated data
